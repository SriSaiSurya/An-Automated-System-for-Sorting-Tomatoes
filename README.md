Embedded Software Development:

Accelerated from a vision algorithm to embedded code through MATLAB. Programmed C++ with code traceability.
Generated executables on embedded hardware - Raspberry Pi.
Tested the code using processor-in-the-loop, and hardware-in-the-loop simulations.
Synthesized code in VHDL and Verilog for FPGAs, along with Vision HDL Toolbox.
Used ARM Compute Library for ARM architectures.
